# API & Web Scraping

This repository contains my practice with APIs, JSON data handling, and basic web scraping using Python.

## 📘 What I'm Learning
- API requests (GET/POST)
- Reading and parsing JSON data
- Using authentication/API keys
- Calling public APIs (weather, currency, movies, news)
- BeautifulSoup basics (HTML parsing)
- Web scraping (titles, prices, links)
- Data extraction and storage

## 🎯 Goal
Build skills in API usage and simple web scraping to collect and process external data using Python.

## 📅 Updates
I will upload scripts and practice files when I reach this stage in my learning roadmap.
